WHAT IS A BRAND?
A Brand is more than just your messaging
graphics, or logo. It is the summary of the
overall feeling or perception your customer
or user has about your products or services. A
Brand Identity is the various graphs, type and
colours used to help impact your brand.
WHAT ARE IDENTITY GUIDELINES?
Identity guidelines are the standards required
to represent your branding correctly. It
contains the instructions, framework and
graphic assets such as logo and typography
that work together to create consistency and

“The smallest particles can make the biggest impact.”
SeaCrop exists where microscopic innovation meets planetary ambition.
From a casual conversation and kitchen experimentation, it has
grown into a mission that moves beyond the technology. With every
breakthrough, SeaCrop demonstrates that even the smallest particles
can unlock enormous change - transforming ocean health, feeding
communities, and restoring ecological balance. This essence reflects our

1.3 – Our Story
STORYOUR
Seven years ago, our journey began with a simple question
asked in casual conversation: ‘How can we feed the world
more affordably?’ What followed was a relentless pursuit of
solutions that could change the way the world thinks about
nutrition at scale.
Co-founder Itai Katz, a PhD physicist at Technion University
in Israel, began experimenting after hours in his own kitchen.
He wanted to understand whether the ocean’s smallest
organisms, phytoplankton, could hold the key to feeding
billions sustainably. What he discovered challenged
conventional thinking.
Phytoplankton naturally carry a negative electric charge.
Instead of relying on heavy, energy-intensive methods to
harvest them, Itai devised a curtain of positively charged

electrostatic fibres, allowing these microscopic powerhouses to
adhere gently without damaging the surrounding ecosystem.
This approach opened up the possibility of farming plankton
efficiently, at scale, and in harmony with the ocean’s natural
systems.
short and holding fast to our mission through every
Recognising the potential of Itai’s work, Shahar joined as a
co-founder, taking on the practical execution of these early
experiments. His ability to translate technical concepts into
working systems became the bridge between breakthrough
science and functional application. Together, Itai and Shahar
built the first steps of what would become SeaCrop.
When Arik Pinto came on board, bringing the operational
expertise to match Itai’s technical vision and Shahar’s
executional drive, SeaCrop truly began to take shape. As a
team, we embraced a mindset of unstoppable problem-
solving, finding new pathways when traditional ones fell
challenge.
Our technology doesn’t just aim to create sustainable
nutrition. By deploying our fibre curtains in eutrophic
waters - areas suffering from nutrient overload and
oxygen depletion - we also help restore balance to marine
ecosystems, reducing oceanic dead zones while creating a
scalable, ocean-friendly feed source.
At SeaCrop, we know that real change takes time. We are
building solutions not just for today, but for generations to
come: farming the smallest life in the ocean so that billions
of people can thrive in the future.
This is more than technology. It’s a promise to the ocean,
to the planet, and to every life it nourishes: a future where
food security and environmental balance go hand in hand.
